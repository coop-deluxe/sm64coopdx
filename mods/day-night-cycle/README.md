# Day Night Cycle DX

This mod adds a fully featured day & night cycle system with night, sunrise, day and sunset to sm64coopdx. It includes an API and hook system for interfacing with several components of the mod externally. This mod was originally made for sm64ex-coop but has been practically rewritten for sm64coopdx and it's new Lua functionality.

Days last 24 minutes and with the /time command, you can set/scale/query the time, add to the time, change the format from AM/PM, sync it with real life time, and toggle the night time music.

There is also now a new menu in the pause menu for Day Night Cycle DX!

Special thanks to MaiskX3 for the night time music.

Special thanks to AngelicMiracles for the sunset, sunrise and night time skyboxes.

Special thanks to eros71 for salvaging the mod files.
