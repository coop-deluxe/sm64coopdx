# Lua Reference

The Lua scripting API is in early development.

Expect many more things to be supported in the future.

<br />

## How to install Lua mods
Lua scripts you make can be placed either the `mods` folder in the base directory, or in `<SAVE FILE LOCATION>/mods`

Save file locations:
- Windows: `%appdata%/sm64ex-coop`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/sm64ex-coop`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/sm64ex-coop`

<br />

## Tips
- When developing Lua mods, run the game from a console. Lua errors and logs will appear there, but only if the game is launched with the `--console` launch parameter.
- You can use the `print()` command when debugging. Your logs will show up in the console.
- You can create a folder within the mods folder containing multiple lua scripts as long as one script is called `main.lua`. Dynos actors can be placed inside this mod folder under `<your mod folder>/actors/`.

## Important notes on player indices

Something important to realize is that the `localIndex` for each player is different (unfortunately).

So the order of `gMarioStates[]`, `gNetworkPlayers[]`, and `gPlayerSyncTable[]` is different for each player.

Luckily `gPlayerSyncTable[]` will automatically translate the player indices, so setting `gPlayerSyncTable[0].example = 1` will set it for the correct player for everyone.

The `globalIndex` of each player is consistent among everyone connected. So if you absolutely need to sort things in order you will have to grab it from `gNetworkPlayers[<LOCAL INDEX HERE>].globalIndex`.

All of this is a holdover from when there were only two players. It was a reasonable idea back then.
