-- name: Custom animation (DynOS)
-- description: No running allowed.\nReplace the running animation by Mario walking.

-- Note 1: Since this method requires an actor to work, it is not very convenient. Consider using the LUA method instead.
-- Note 2: To make this mod work properly, copy the content of the repository actors/mario folder to the mod's actors/mario folder.
-- Note 3: Animation index 0x72 is MARIO_ANIM_RUNNING, the animation we want to replace.
