# sm64ex-coop
Online multiplayer mod for SM64, aiming to synchronize all entities and every level for multiple players.
Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). 

Build instructions are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop/wiki).

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**. 
Run `./extract_assets.py --clean && make clean` or `make distclean` to remove ROM-originated content.

## Goal
Create a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play online together.
Unlike previous online attempts, this one will synchronize enemies and events such that you will be interacting with the same world at the same time.
